## 📝 Migration Notes

All existing functionality has been preserved during the refactoring. The changes are primarily structural improvements that enhance the codebase without breaking existing features. The application should continue to work exactly as before, but with improved maintainability and developer experience.

The refactoring follows React and Next.js best practices, ensuring the codebase is ready for future scaling and feature additions.
